Okay I'm writing this about not feeling so overwhelmed all of the time. I don't just mean from work. For a while I've always felt like my head is full of useless crap constantly whizzing past my consciousness until something snags my attention. Then it snowballs, and by the time I know it I'm 10 minutes into a fake scenario playing out in my head that stresses me out.

And yeah meditating helps, of course it does. Last night I meditated so long that my body felt like it was in one of those spinning carnival rides that pushes you up against the wall. It was kind of overwhelming and I decided to stop actually. But before that I noticed how vague images and sounds were flitting in and out of my mind surprisingly fast. Sometimes one of them would remind me of something noteworthy (usually in a bad way) and it would hold my attention. I got to the point though where I could just let those things whiz by me and not follow anything.

It was kind of like they cleared through my brain without any stopping interaction.
